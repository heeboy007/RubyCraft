# RubyCraft
A Copy Of Minecraft... But not in c, c++, java, but in ruby!

The files won't execute properly if there is no ruby interpreter or no gitbash installed.
When you try to execute, please check out the 'gemlist.txt' and see if there is anything missing from your computer.
The core gem of this program is glu,opengl,rbsfml.

Notice!
Current version of the game has not only lots of flaws and bugs, but also very poor performance.
More than 3~4 blocks will lag your computer! 
So before you execute, BE CAREFUL!!!
